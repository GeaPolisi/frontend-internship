# Shero Front-End Internship – Technical Test

This repository contains my submission for the Front-End Internship technical test at Shero. The project was built in three phases as instructed.

---

## ✅ Phase 1 – Static Website (HTML & CSS)

- Built with semantic HTML5 structure (`<header>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`, etc.).
- Layout structured using **CSS Grid** and **Flexbox** as specified:
  - Three-image section: CSS Grid
  - Other sections: Flexbox
- Placeholder images used from:
  - https://placeholderimage.dev/
  - http://via.placeholder.com/2550x550
- Minimal, well-structured CSS for performance.
- Alt text provided for all images (SEO-friendly).
- Pixel-perfect styling based on the reference design.

---

## ✅ Phase 2 – Interactivity (JavaScript)

- Implemented a **carousel** using [GlideJS](https://glidejs.com/).
- The carousel responds to user interaction and transitions smoothly.
- Navigation arrows and indicators are positioned as per the design.

---

## ✅ Phase 3 – Mobile Responsiveness

- The layout adapts to different screen sizes:
  - One image per slide on small screens
  - Two on tablets
  - Three on larger screens
- Content shifts from multi-column to single-column layout on mobile.
- The header and footer are adjusted for better mobile usability.
